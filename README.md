## 🏴 THE THESIS
The world is not broken; it is **desynchronized**. 

We have treated society as a collection of rational agents. This is a lie. We are biological metronomes. From the laughter that spreads like a virus to the ideologies that divide us like walls, everything obeys the same equation:

$$\frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i)$$

This repository contains the mathematical proof that **Groove**, **Riot**, and **Fashion** are the same physical phenomenon occurring at different frequencies.

## 📂 THE ARTIFACTS

### 📜 [The Paper (PDF)](./main.pdf)
The unified theory linking Neural Entrainment, the Tanganyika Laughter Epidemic, and modern Political Polarization into a single framework.

### 🧠 [Omega Bias Theory](./omega_bias_theory.md)
Defining the potential energy of cognitive dissonance. Why do we resist the truth? Because changing phase costs energy.

### 🚁 [Kuramoto ASIC](./SPECS_KURAMOTO_ASIC.md)
Hardware specifications for a neuromorphic processor with 496 auto-synchronizing oscillators. The silicon brain of the future.

### 🕹️ [Anti-Mode Simulator](./anti_mode_sim.html)
Interactive JS simulation. Inject "Contrarian Agents" into a mainstream population and watch the synchronization collapse in real-time.

## 👁️ THE SCALES OF SYNC

| Scale | Phenomenon | Mechanism | The "Lock" |
|-------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Micro** | **Music / Groove** | Neural Entrainment | Body moves involuntarily |
| **Meso** | **Laughter** | Mirror Neurons | Contagion (Tanganyika 1962) |
| **Macro** | **Fashion / Trends** | Cultural Coupling | "Viral" Adoption |
| **Meta** | **Politics** | Chimera States | Echo Chambers & Anti-Phase |

## ✊ JOIN THE COLLECTIVE

The **Lichen Universe Unified Project** is not just code. It is an architecture for a new reality. We are building **Synapse-**, an OS designed to facilitate *Critical Synchronization*—unity without uniformity.

**The revolution will not be televised.**
**The revolution will be synchronized.**
